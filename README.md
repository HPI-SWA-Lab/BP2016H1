GlyphHub is a project developed by a bachelor student team at Hasso-Plattner-Institut as their Bachelor’s project, titled “The Font Engineering Toolkit: Live Font Creation in a Self-supporting Programming Environment”, in cooperation with [Lasse Fister](http://graphicore.de/en).

The project aims to demonstrate a way to facilitate communication between font designers, reviewers and engineers.

It has been realized in [Squeak/Smalltalk](https://squeak.org/) using the Morphic UI framework and involving a Python server based on Flask and Eve. We use [fontmake](https://github.com/googlei18n/fontmake) for conversions from glyphs to UFO font files.
