    content: "Hello colleagues,

        I am working on Bitter, expanding the project to 9 instances.

        I spent the last week designing the Thin and the Black masters.
        Attached you can find a .gif with images of the Latin set I’ve been working on.
        I am making some changes as you can see in the /x/.

      Tomorrow:
        I will be focused on Numerals, all number related glyphs and symbols.

        Sincerely,

        Sol"

            This is great! 

            I wonder if your more unusual 'x' could find a place in the default glyph set in these more extreme weights, and be available as a stylistic alternate in the middle weights? :)"

    content: "Hello all, 

        This past week i've been working on expanding Pablo Impallari's Cabin to the Google Pro glyph-set.

        While working on the expansion I came across an interesting problem. On all the fonts I have worked on up until Cabin, there was minimal to no additional work required with regards to the existing glyphs (and their outlines) especially in the core Latin character-set. Unfortunately in Cabin, there are many instances where additional work needs to be done to raise the over-all quality of the typeface. 

        Some examples of original outlines (inferiors-Bold):

        A before/after of reworked outlines:

        I wanted to ask Pablo, Omer, and Dave of their opinions on performing such changes. They might take an extra 3-4 days but will result in a high-quality, large-family Pro typeface. 


        Best, 

        Kalapi"

    content: "Hello, first time poster and Font newbie here.

        I have an existing font I want to extend.  The font has a 'basic' western alphabet only.  (I have permission from the creator.)

        I have FontLab, and have done a couple basic tutorials.  My questions are:

        1.  Given a list of countries (and or languages), how do i determine exactly which alphabets are needed?  For example Greece, i understand has special special Greek characters.  Is this a whole new alphabet?  Just a few characters past western basic set?  Is there a resource somewhere for this?

        2.  Given the source .vfb file in FontLab, how do i go about extending it properly?  (I know how to bring in letters from Illustrator thanks to this tut: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI-7e4nRNus   But its for new fonts.   I dont have a 'template' for the new characters in my existing font.  Where do the new shapes GO?  How do i ensure they are in the proper order / ascii code or whatever?

        3.  Finally, once i have it BUILT, how do i go about actually using it in Photoshop or Illustrator etc.?   Even characters like the '£ ' (which is in the current set), is unaccessable from my USA keyboard.  Any suggestion for working w/ these fonts once Im' done?


        Sorry for the deluge of basic questions; hopefully the answers will benefit others also,  

        Thanks in advance!

        -Mr Do.

        Also (for #1 above)   

        According to http://www.evertype.com/alphabets/,  for Europe there is this list:

        Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Armenian, Hebrew, Arabic, and Georgian

        But my research on Google Fonts shows this list:

        ·        Cyrrilic
        ·        Cyrrilic Extended
        ·        Greek
        ·        Greek Extended
        ·        Khmer
        ·        Latin
        ·        Latin Extended
        ·        Vietnamese

        WhWhich is correct for Europe?"

            http://www.unicode.org is your friend ;)

            Here's the codepage for Greek

            I don't recommend drawing in Illustrator then converting. You usually end up with conversion errors due to diff grid sizes. Draw directly in FontLab.

            You can change your keyboard layout if you need pound sterling ;)

    content: "Hi all,

The next few weeks I will be working on Nunito. 

Nunito is a rounded Neo Grotesque font designed by Vernon Adams. Nunito is a Sans Serif with rounded terminals. According to the description on Google fonts, Nunito has been designed mainly to be used as a display font but is useable as a text font too. The overall character is good and somewhat vibrant and/or lively.

I have made a deck for Nunito and my proposal how to improve Nunito.
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZdkBTLfAfKsN2ACSBRVrBiDLWJIqGp1HJYjlm19M7U4/edit?ts=57a488ec#slide=id.g15a03d75bb_0_15

On this thread I will post updates on the design process."

          content: "Hi

Thomas had a great idea to use fontreach to check out popular (Alexa Top 1M domains) examples of the fonts in use, and I just  checked http://www.fontreach.com/#font:Nunito and found these (work safe! ;) sites using Nunito. 

http://www.girlsgogames.com

http://www.topuniversities.com

http://www.meetme.com (http://www.meetmecorp.com)

As you can see, it is used in headlines but it is also used extensively in body text too, so I think moving the design more towards display type, and respacing tighter, could go too far. 

On the other hand, resolutions (especially of mobile devices which make up a huge percentage of web page views in 2016) are going up up up and so many of the fonts released in 2010-2012 like Nunito were intentionally spaced a little loose to account for the lower resolutions of the day. 

So, I'm not offering specific advice about if your sketches are too tightly spaced; my point is only that I'd like you to not move the design too far towards display and ensure it is still working well for these sites in text. 

From your sketches (reposted below) I think your spacing is better, but perhaps just a tiny bit too tight in the Black. The Thin looks good.

I think generally its better to err towards looser spacing as typographers are accustomed to tracking in at larger sizes, than thinking to track out at smaller sizes. 


And going back to the websites, I have a good way to test work in progress in just this 'live' situation! :) 

Sadly http://somadesign.ca/projects/fontfriend/ no longer works, but it made it easy to test a font on your machine in any webpage - https://vimeo.com/8243800 shows it off. 

I wondered if there was anything else - http://typewonder.com is a more slick approach, but doesn't allow you to toggle the fonts in use on the page, or add local fonts. (https://webfonter.fontshop.com/?url=http://www.meetmecorp.com/ is a FontShop one but seems to use less reliable techniques; it also doesn't allow local fonts to be used - so I just fixed it :) 

You can grab the bookmarklet link from in the top text of https://davelab6.github.io/font-friend/ and it should then work as explained at the end of the video :) 

The font data never leaves your computer so you can use this little tool with peace of mind :) "
