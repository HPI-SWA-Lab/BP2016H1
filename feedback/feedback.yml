          is conventionally larger than the Latin breve, and stylistically quite different in serif types. I am wondering whether it is appropriate to carry this convention across the extended Cyrillic diacritic characters, i.e. to have a single Cyrillic-specific breve form, or if any of the language communities using these characters have a preference for a breve that follows the Latin model? Anyone have any information?

For example, trying to set Genesis with fonts that support Vietnamese often results in ḿ ṇ ṛ missing. Online lists of the Vietnamese alphabet are often missing these and other letters, like ø. The Scriptsource list of characters for Vietnamese fonts contains many characters not in Vietnamese because it includes complete codepages containing characters used in Vietnam. Is there a reliable list somewhere? Are ḿ ṇ ṛ and ø just errors in old text?"

          The archaic writing of the names of the trigrams are generally the same or in phonetically or graphical related versions of those found in hexagram texts. A few examples include, Qian 乾 is written <Glyph 1>;… Zhen 震 is written as <Glyph 2>. Two regional variants that also appear in the Wangjiatai Guicang include Li 離is written as Luo 羅, Kan 坎 is written as <Glyph 3> (read as Lao 勞).[1] So as not to confuse readers, the trigrams in this study are referred to by their traditional names.

      title: Sailboat - a Grotesque
      content: "I began designing this typeface (my first) last November, and would really like to get some critiques by people who are more experienced. My only type education is Designing Type by Karen Cheng, which I began reading last November, and otherwise I’m only familiar with typography from Bringhurst and general online reading. So please by all means tear it apart.

          Concept:

          For a while I’ve been trying out various typefaces for one that would match the landscape and community I am in. This area began to be developed towards the beginning of the last century, near a lake in the mountains where sailing, swimming, etc., are popular. I came across Bold Monday’s Trio Grotesk which seemed to match perfectly, but it was too eccentric and too wide (doesn’t fit with the many tall trees in this area as well as the significant human presence).

      So I began designing this font with these traits in mind: civilized but used to the outdoors; reminiscent of monospace typewriter fonts to recall the roots and simplicity of the community (some of the printed materials in this area were typeset with typewriters).

          Its intended use is print, ideally both display and body text, but at the moment it displays poorly at small sizes (see page 4 of PDF) so unless I can fix that it may only be suited to display usage.

          It is obviously a work in progress, but I thought it would be better to get feedback now rather than later. Your thoughts?"

      title: Cyrillic script variations and the importance of localisation
      comments:
          - author: Christian Thalmann
          - content: "I rather like its flavor and its backstory. First impressions:
              Lowercase spacing is much too loose; hence the unexpected behavior at text sizes.
              The rounds often seem too «pointy», i.e. diamond-shaped, in particular in /O and /c. 
              Does the stroke width oscillate in a quadrupole pattern, i.e. become broader in the diagonals, in the round strokes?
              Widths feel a bit inconsistent, with e.g. /M/R/a/m on the wide end and /G/H/L/T on the narrow end.
              /a feels a bit droopy, foot of /t timid, head of /f short.
              Serif on /7 feels out of character to me."

    content: "[...] Localised forms aren’t offered with every Pro font and are an underused feature for those that do. Besides the character count, there are also differences in the way some letters look. Countries with different history and development of writing and printing, have also developed different forms of the same alphabet. For example, in Bulgaria mass printing arrived much later than in Russia, so the shapes of the Bulgarian Cyrillic are more influenced by handwriting and calligraphy.

Wow, I think it looks fantastic at reading size - great proportions, spacing.

But your drawings are much lumpier than your Latin. I think you should crisp them up. There are a few pointy areas on the Ka, and some other characters, and the \"ink fill\" in the corner of where the verticals and horizontal top line meet are a too heavy - they don't match your Latin.

If you need more specific notes, let me know! 

Looks great!

Lots of thanks!

  - content: "Hey you two,

Some points:

I think that the out-stroke on the bottom of your Ha should not flare out. That doesn’t make sense to me, from a  writing perspective. That kind of flare does make sense of the Ra. But on the Ha, I think it is too much!

The middle of Ka and especially Pha are too dark. It looks like the characters have been written with one-too-many strokes. Why not try to have the bottom-left strokes of Ka and Pha continue in one fluid visible motion over to the top right-hand of those letters? It would make each character look like single, more coherent glyphs, rather than characters with distinctly separate left and right halves. Perhaps this means that you will have to tinker with Pa, Va, Ba and maybe Kha a little as well.

The Latin and the Devanagari seem to be harmonising with each other very nicely! Good work.

Best,
Dan"

  - content: "Hi,
I have a few suggestions
- make the circular part of द smaller. It appears big as compared to other characters.
- knots of म, भ can be bigger / vertically longer. they look small especially at smaller sizes.
- you can try a version of र स which are more vertically balanced (rather than the tail sticking out too much on the right)
- the ध that you have designed will be very similar to घ
- the tail of ह can be shorter. ह can also be wider
- counters of क can be smaller
- the widths of the 2 vertical lines in म are very different. They can be visually consistent. Similarly the horizontal stroke is currently thinner than the shirorekha, it needs to be of the same width or thicker.
- the vertical bar can be further away from the initial part of अ
- in the ञ the lower stroke in the extending upwards can be shorter 
- the upper portion of the  ी matra should be wider or less curved in. Ideally the matra should land on the vertical bar of the character for which it is used. Its Ok if the matra does not touch the shirorekha but it should visually appear to land on the vertical bar.
