## Colors

Colors are managed via BTColorScheme. A BTColorScheme is a triple of foreground, background and border color. To influence the colors your BTWidget subclass gets you can either set a BTColorScheme directly (colorScheme:) or override colorMode and return one of the valid color modes as listed in `BTColorScheme class>>type:mode:` to modify the default color palettes. If you want to receive the same colorScheme as your parent, simply set `colorScheme: #inherit`
