A FRTGlyphPreviewWidget gives a preview of a single glyph. In the top right, it shows a count of how many threads are associated to its glyph.
Instanciate by giving it a FRTRenderer, assigning glyph by calling glyph: and then setting it's fontsize: (in that order).
It is used and mostly created by the FTRGlyphGridWidget.
